# Qiskit Camp Europe 2019

## I have an idea for the hackathon

Open an issue using the `New project template` template.
Don't worry if your team is not complete yet.
Tag your project with `members wanted` and describe what kind of member are your searching for in the `Members` section.
At the behing of the hackathon, the project should have no more than 5 members.

## My team is complete

Ask an IBMer in the channel `#qiskit-camp-europe` (qiskit.slack.com) to remove the label `members wanted`.

## The project is ready. Let's hack!

After the project is defined and the team is complete, you can sk an IBMer in the channel `#qiskit-camp-europe` (qiskit.slack.com) to add the label `group ready`. This should happend before the group formation stage finished, around noon of the first day. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A coach is an IBMer that guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.
